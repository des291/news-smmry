[{"title": "England v South Africa: Ben Stokes' side seal 2-1 series win", "text": "England completed their remarkable summer with a series-clinching nine-wicket victory over South Africa at the Kia Oval. The home side took only 25 minutes to hit the 33 runs they needed for victory on the fifth morning of the third and deciding Test. Zak Crawley ended 69 not out, with Ollie Pope unbeaten on 11 after Alex Lees was lbw on review to Kagiso Rabada for 39. Victory was earned in little more than two days of play after day one was washed out and day two cancelled as a mark of respect following the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. It gives captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum a sixth win from seven Tests in their first summer in charge, a complete turnaround from England's previous run of one win in 17. Only once before have England won more than five Tests in a home summer, when they took a clean sweep of seven victories in 2004. South Africa miss out on the chance to return to the top of the table in the World Test Championship, where they are vying with Australia, India and Pakistan for a place in the final. The defeat ends the Proteas' run of four Test series unbeaten. An almost entirely different England squad now turns its attention to preparations for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October, with a seven-match series in Pakistan beginning on 20 September. England's winter Test assignments are in Pakistan in December and New Zealand in February. Monday morning was a contrast to the buoyant atmosphere of Sunday evening, when England were romping the chase in front of a full house only to be stopped by bad light. Still, those that took up the offer of free admission saw the frantic cricket continue. From 97-0, Crawley and Lees reached a century stand from the second ball of the day - 17.2 overs is the fastest hundred opening partnership in England's Test history. Lees was dropped by wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne off the bowling of Rabada from the next ball and in the following over the left-hander edged Marco Jansen over the slips. Rabada finally pinned Lees with one that nipped back, bringing in Pope to try an audacious reverse scoop at Jansen that resulted in a helmet blow and a concussion test. It was left to Crawley to strike the winning boundary in an innings that repaid the faith shown in him by Stokes and McCullum. He recorded his highest home Test score since the 267 he made against Pakistan in 2020. Crawley's punch to the cover boundary off Jansen ended a series that has been completed in less than nine days of action on the field. In terms of balls bowled - 3,411 - it is the shortest three-match series not to contain a draw since the 1888 Ashes, 134 years ago. Stokes, McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key have reversed England's fortunes through unflinching faith in the players, a commitment to aggressive cricket and making the environment around the national team as relaxed as possible. Some key moments of fortune have fallen their way, but more than luck was needed to beat the calibre of opponents put in their path. England defeated world Test champions New Zealand 3-0, won a rescheduled match against second-ranked India and have now beaten a Proteas side that arrived as leaders of the Test Championship. A squad for the Pakistan series could be chosen by the end of the month, possibly overseen by a new national selector, a restored post which was advertised for last week. England will certainly be without Jonny Bairstow, who had surgery on a broken leg sustained in a golfing accident on Monday and may even miss the tour to New Zealand. Stuart Broad, whose first child is due in the autumn, may sit out the Pakistan tour, with fellow pacers Mark Wood, Chris Woakes, Jamie Overton and Saqib Mahmood vying to be fit. Off-spinner Moeen Ali is likely to return to partner Jack Leach, Liam Livingstone could provide an all-round option, while Nottinghamshire left-armer Liam Patterson-White featured for England Lions against South Africa last month. : \"It has been very pleasing to be able to captain this side. The lads' mindset and attitude towards the whole summer has been fantastic. The fact that different people have put their hand up at different times in the Test matches has been great. \"I'll never forget walking down the stairs on day three to complete silence from 30,000 people. The silence was deafening. I've never experienced anything like it before and it was seriously special to be part of it. To sing the anthem with the little change was special again. I will never forget that day.\"  \"The guys have bought into the style the captain has asked for, a style that is authentic to him, and the way he leads, and, while the results have been fantastic, the mentality shift has been quite amazing. It has been something quite special to be a part of. \"I thought Ben [Stokes] would be good but I didn't realise he'd be this good.\" \"It is really pleasing to put in this performance and get the series win. It is my first series win in an England shirt and it has been a great week and a great few weeks to be back around the lads. \"It is a very enjoyable, free-flowing environment. I think Baz [McCullum] and Stokesy just oozed that confidence in the players and they give you that sort of extra lift when you need it.\"  \"The series has been disappointing and there is a little bit of frustration. We came here with high hopes. \"It was a massive learning curve for a lot of us, there are a lot of young guys in our batting line-up and I'm sure they've been exposed to what Test cricket is really like and what the standard is about and the intensity of play. In a sense that is positive but it is still disappointing to not get the results in our favour.\"", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/62864990?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA            ", "summary": ["It gives captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum a sixth win from seven Tests in their first summer in charge, a complete turnaround from England's previous run of one win in 17.", "Only once before have England won more than five Tests in a home summer, when they took a clean sweep of seven victories in 2004.", "South Africa miss out on the chance to return to the top of the table in the World Test Championship, where they are vying with Australia, India and Pakistan for a place in the final.", "The defeat ends the Proteas' run of four Test series unbeaten.", "Stokes, McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key have reversed England's fortunes through unflinching faith in the players, a commitment to aggressive cricket and making the environment around the national team as relaxed as possible.", "England defeated world Test champions New Zealand 3-0, won a rescheduled match against second-ranked India and have now beaten a Proteas side that arrived as leaders of the Test Championship.", "It is my first series win in an England shirt and it has been a great week and a great few weeks to be back around the lads."]}, {"title": "Arsenal-PSV postponed but EFL and WSL games back on", "text": "Arsenal's Europa League tie with PSV Eindhoven has been postponed because of \"severe limitations on police resources\" following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.

England went on to win the Test by nine wickets for  a 2-1 series victory. Stokes said he will \"never forget\" the atmosphere at The Oval on Saturday. The crowd fell silent as the players and umpires, all wearing black armbands, entered the field through a military guard of honour, before the official minute's silence was observed. Singer Laura Wright performed the anthems, firstly of South Africa before God Save The King, followed by sustained applause from the crowd. \"I'll never forget walking down the steps out of the changing room to complete silence,\" said Stokes. \"We didn't know that was going to happen.

Players usually receive \u00a3800 per Test, but are playing the United States and Wales for \u00a3400 per game in September. Players' union the Women's Rugby Association (WRA) called the RFU decision \"disappointing\". But Hunter hailed the RFU's investment in the women's game, saying players agreed to the cut in advance. The lower match fee was agreed by the players after discussions between the Rugby Players Association (RPA) and the RFU. \"We agreed to it. We signed our contract months ago so that we wouldn't have to have conversations around match fees,\" said Hunter, whose side face Wales in Bristol on Wednesday. \"We just want to focus on the game on Wednesday then the World Cup, not on what the match fees are, what they could be or what they should be. \"Our focus is purely on our next game.\" England, whose World Cup campaign in New Zealand begins against Fiji on 8 October, became the first union to offer full-time contracts to their women's XVs side in 2019. Despite record-breaking crowds during the 2022 Women's Six Nations, the RFU continues to run the team at a loss.  Players now receive between \u00a326,000 and \u00a333,000 per year for their England involvement.  The RFU told BBC Sport that match fees \"vary across Test matches and tournaments\" and \"all 36 players in camp receive this fee, not just the matchday 23\". It is understood the RFU has increased the value of contracts by about 15-20% in the past year, with the vast majority of the union's revenue still coming from men's Tests at Twickenham. England's men are not centrally contracted, but get a match fee of about \u00a317,000.  Asked whether similar discussions around match fees would take place with the men's side before their World Cup in 2023, the RFU said: \"Contract information is commercially sensitive and we don't disclose financial details as they are confidential.\" The WRA said the women's fee change was \"disappointing given the current success and recent achievements of the Red Roses\".  Should the women's side beat Wales on Wednesday, they will become the first team to win 25 Tests in a row.  They are ranked number one in the world and go into October's World Cup as favourites.  A WRA statement added: \"We hope this is resolved in a timely manner to ensure all focus can be on the preparations for Rugby World Cup 2021 [being played in 2022].\"  In football, England men's and women's senior players have been paid the same match fees and bonuses for representing their country  since 2020. Asked if she would like to see this in rugby, Hunter said: \"Not to sound like a stuck record, I'm sure those conversations will happen.   \"New contracts will happen. You've just got to look at what the RFU has done for investment in the women's game. It is more than anyone else on and off the pitch.  \"I'm sure those negotiations on match fees will be done with the RFU, with the players and with the RPA to come to some agreement that everyone is happy with.   \"We're just here to play rugby and those conversations will be taken up in the next contractual talks.\"  The RPA told BBC Sport it \"entered into discussions with the RFU\" about raising the match fee \"to Test match levels\".
