[{"title": "Ukraine war: What will Russia's losses mean for Putin?", "text": "But yesterday's edition opened with a rare admission.  \"On the frontlines of the special operation [in Ukraine], this has been the toughest week so far,\" declared sombre-looking anchor Dmitry Kiselev. \"It was particularly tough along the Kharkiv front, where following an onslaught by enemy forces that outnumbered ours, [Russian] troops were forced to leave towns they had previously liberated.\" For \"liberated\", read \"seized\". Moscow had occupied those areas months ago, but after a lightning counter-offensive by the Ukrainian army, the Russian military has lost considerable territory in north-east Ukraine.  Still, Russian state media are putting a brave face on things. Officially, what happened in Kharkiv region isn't being referred to here as a \"retreat\". \"The Russian defence ministry dismissed rumours that Russian troops fled in disgrace from Balakliya, Kupiansk and Izyum,\" claimed the latest edition of the government paper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. \"They didn't flee. This was a pre-planned regrouping.\" In tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets, a military analyst took a different view: \"It's already clear that we underestimated the enemy. [Russian forces] took too long to react and the collapse came\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 As a result, we suffered a defeat and tried to minimise the loss by withdrawing our troops so they weren't surrounded.\"  This \"defeat\" has sparked anger on pro-Russian social media channels and among \"patriotic\" Russian bloggers, who have accused their military of making mistakes.  So has the powerful leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  \"If today or tomorrow no changes in strategy are made,\" Mr Kadyrov warned, \"I will be forced to speak with the leadership of the defence ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground to them. It's a very interesting situation. It's astounding.\" It's more than six months since Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In the days that followed, I remember Russian politicians, commentators and analysts on TV here predicting that what the Kremlin calls its \"special military operation\" would be wrapped up within days; that the Ukrainian people would greet Russian troops as liberators, and that Ukraine's government would collapse like a pack of cards. It didn't.  Instead, more than six months on, the Russian army has been losing ground.  This video can not be played WATCH: Ukraine seizes abandoned Russian tanks So, here's a key question: will this have political consequences for Vladimir Putin? After all, for more than 20 years, Mr Putin has, within the Russian elite, enjoyed a reputation for being a winner; for always managing to extricate himself from the tightest of spots; in short, for being invincible. I've often viewed him as the Russian version of famous escape artist Harry Houdini. Whatever knots or chains he got tied up in, Mr Putin always managed to slip free. That changed after 24 February.  The last six months suggest that President Putin's decision to invade Ukraine was a major miscalculation. Unable to secure a rapid victory, Russia got bogged down in a long, bloody offensive, and has suffered a series of embarrassing defeats.  When an authoritarian leader's aura of invincibility fades, it can cause problems for the aforesaid leader. Vladimir Putin will know Russia's history. It hasn't ended well for past Russian leaders who fought wars and didn't win them.  Russia's defeat by Japan led to the first Russian Revolution of 1905. Military failures in World War One sparked the 1917 Revolution and the end of the Tsar. Publicly, though, President Putin has no intention of ending up the loser.  On Monday, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists: \"[Russia's] special military operation continues and will continue until all the tasks that were initially set have been fulfilled.\" Which brings us to the other key question: what will Mr Putin do next?  You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone here who knows what Vladimir Putin is thinking and planning. Much may depend on how accurate the information is that he is receiving from his military and intelligence chiefs.  But here are two things we do know: the Russian president rarely admits to making mistakes. And he rarely makes U-turns.  From what the state media is saying, we're already seeing signs that failures on the battlefield are being blamed on Western support for Ukraine. \"Kyiv, backed by Nato, launched a counter-offensive,\" declared Russian state TV. There is one more uncomfortable question that's been in the background for months: if he cannot achieve victory via conventional weapons, would President Putin go nuclear? Only a few days ago, Ukraine's military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, warned: \"There is a direct threat of the use, under certain circumstances, of tactical nuclear weapons by the Russian armed forces.\" For now, there are no open signs of panic in the Kremlin. Russian state TV is sounding more positive. It's been describing Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure as \"a turning point in the special operation\".", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62879367?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA            ", "summary": ["Moscow had occupied those areas months ago, but after a lightning counter-offensive by the Ukrainian army, the Russian military has lost considerable territory in north-east Ukraine.", "\"The Russian defence ministry dismissed rumours that Russian troops fled in disgrace from Balakliya, Kupiansk and Izyum,\" claimed the latest edition of the government paper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta.", "In the days that followed, I remember Russian politicians, commentators and analysts on TV here predicting that what the Kremlin calls its \"special military operation\" would be wrapped up within days; that the Ukrainian people would greet Russian troops as liberators, and that Ukraine's government would collapse like a pack of cards.", "On Monday, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists: \"[Russia's] special military operation continues and will continue until all the tasks that were initially set have been fulfilled.\"", "But here are two things we do know: the Russian president rarely admits to making mistakes.", "\"Kyiv, backed by Nato, launched a counter-offensive,\" declared Russian state TV.", "Only a few days ago, Ukraine's military chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, warned: \"There is a direct threat of the use, under certain circumstances, of tactical nuclear weapons by the Russian armed forces.\""]}, {"title": "Ukraine war: Russians 'outnumbered 8-1' in counter-attack", "text": "WATCH: Ukraine seizes abandoned Russian tanks Ukrainian forces outnumbered Russians by eight to one in last week's counter-attack in the Kharkiv region, Russia's top occupation official there says.   Vitaly Ganchev told Russian TV that Ukraine's army had taken villages in the north and broken through to the Russian border. Ukraine says it has regained control over 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) of territory in a potential breakthrough in the six-month war. The BBC cannot verify these figures. The Ukrainian army says it took back 20 villages in the past 24 hours alone, in its continued counter-offensive in the north-east of the country. It also said its forces have taken control of around 500 sq km in the southern Kherson region of the country. UK defence officials say the Ukrainian army's successes will have \"significant implications\" for Russia's overall operational design. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was, however, undeterred, saying operations in Ukraine would continue \"until all the tasks that were initially set\" had been fulfilled. President Vladimir Putin is constantly being updated with the latest developments, he added.   Russia said its forces were carrying out strikes in those areas that Ukraine had retaken recently.  This included targets in Izyum and Kupiansk which were taken by Ukraine on Saturday. Russia confirmed its forces' retreat from both towns, which it said would allow them to \"regroup\". Valerii Marchenko, mayor of Izyum, told the BBC the Ukrainian army was in his city and the state flag had been raised.  The military is now engaged in cleaning up the war-torn city and Ukrainian forces are searching for Russian soldiers potentially hiding in people's houses.  Mr Marchenko said that after \"about 10 days\", residents who had to flee the city would be able to return \"safely\".  Russia has been accused of targeting civilian infrastructure in revenge for setbacks on the battlefield. A wave of missile strikes on Sunday caused power cuts across the region. This video can not be played Watch: Widespread blackouts in Ukraine The blackouts reportedly affected millions of people in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.  Ukraine's Defence Minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said the priority now was to secure the territorial gains made in a week of rapid advances in the Kharkiv region.  The Russian army appears to have abandoned large quantities of equipment and ammunition as it withdrew from areas it had held since the first weeks of the war. A Russian battle-tank maker has switched to \"round-the-clock\" production after these setbacks, according to reports.  Workers at Uralvagonzavod in Nizhny Tagil, Russia's largest armoured vehicle manufacturer, have reportedly not been allowed to go on vacation due to the \"production necessity\". By Hugo Bachega, BBC News, Kyiv Ukraine's rapid progress seems to have stunned Russia. The Kremlin says its troops are regrouping, but pictures from some liberated areas in the Kharkiv region suggest a hasty departure by the invading forces, with military vehicles, ammunition, and equipment left behind.  If the gains are confirmed - and if they hold - it's the most significant change on the frontlines since Russian troops left the Kyiv region five months ago. The extraordinary advance would mark a humiliating setback for Russia, and be a boost to Ukraine's position that it can push the Russians out while asking for more Western weapons.", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62874557?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA            ", "summary": ["WATCH: Ukraine seizes abandoned Russian tanks Ukrainian forces outnumbered Russians by eight to one in last week's counter-attack in the Kharkiv region, Russia's top occupation official there says.", "Ukraine says it has regained control over 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) of territory in a potential breakthrough in the six-month war.", "Valerii Marchenko, mayor of Izyum, told the BBC the Ukrainian army was in his city and the state flag had been raised.", "This video can not be played Watch: Widespread blackouts in Ukraine The blackouts reportedly affected millions of people in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions.", "Ukraine's Defence Minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said the priority now was to secure the territorial gains made in a week of rapid advances in the Kharkiv region.", "The Kremlin says its troops are regrouping, but pictures from some liberated areas in the Kharkiv region suggest a hasty departure by the invading forces, with military vehicles, ammunition, and equipment left behind.", "If the gains are confirmed - and if they hold - it's the most significant change on the frontlines since Russian troops left the Kyiv region five months ago."]}, {"title": "Thousands line Edinburgh's streets to see Queen's coffin", "text": "The Queen's children, led by King Charles III, walked behind the hearse as it drove from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St Giles' Cathedral. A service of remembrance was then held in the cathedral. The Queen will lie at rest in St Giles' until Tuesday afternoon, allowing members of the public to pay their last respects. Preparations have been made to accommodate a queue that could stretch from the historic cathedral to the city's Meadows park, a distance of about three-quarters of a mile. There was a respectful silence from the crowd, which was 10 deep in places, as the procession took place on Monday afternoon. The quiet was punctuated by the echo of ceremonial gunshots which were fired from Edinburgh Castle every minute. All four of the Queen's children - King Charles, Princess Anne and Princes Andrew and Edward - walked behind the hearse, along with Princess Anne's husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. A car behind them carried Camilla, the Queen Consort, and Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, Prince Edward's wife. By BBC Scotland's Andrew Picken, on the Royal Mile As the procession edged closer the crowd fell silent and cries of \"she's here\" were heard.  There was a sea of hands holding phones in the air to try and capture the moment on camera while a barking dog momentarily put the police horses on edge.  From the back of the crowd a cry of \"God Save the King\" came as the coffin passed the Canons' Gait pub. The silence lingered for a few moments after the procession had passed as people collected their thoughts.  Police Scotland said a 22 year-old man had been arrested in connection with a breach of the peace after footage appeared to show a man heckling the royal procession on the Royal Mile. The King had addressed both Houses of Parliament earlier on Monday, before he and the Queen Consort flew to Edinburgh. He was welcomed on the tarmac by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and Edinburgh's Lord Provost, Robert Aldridge. They then travelled to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where there was applause as the King and the Queen Consort met members of the public. The monarch spent time shaking hands and also received gifts of flowers. King Charles then took part in the ancient Ceremony of the Keys, where he was handed the keys to the city by the lord provost. In keeping with tradition, he handed them back, entrusting their safekeeping to the city's elected officials. King Charles III also inspected a guard of honour from the Royal Regiment of Scotland.  He then led the procession to St Giles' Cathedral behind the Queen's coffin, which was draped with the Royal Standard in Scotland and dressed with a wreath of flowers. The cathedral then hosted a service celebrating the Queen's life and her connection to Scotland. The Rev Calum MacLeod, who led the service, welcomed the Royal family, representatives of \"our nation's life\" and \"people whose lives were touched by the Queen in so many unforgettable ways\". He said: \"We gather to bid Scotland's farewell to our late monarch, whose life of service to the nation and the world we celebrate. And whose love for Scotland was legendary.\" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon read a lesson during the service, while Karen Matheson sang a psalm. A motion of condolence, attended by the King, will be heard in the chamber of the Scottish Parliament at about 17:30. The King will respond to the motion, and will also meet Ms Sturgeon. Mourners will start filing past the Queen's coffin at St Giles' Cathedral at about 17:30, and the King and his siblings are due to post a vigil around the coffin at 19:20. While the Queen lies at rest at St Giles' Cathedral, her coffin will remain under continuous vigil for 24 hours, guarded by the Royal Company of Archers. The queue to view the coffin starts at George Square Lane/North Meadow Walk in The Meadows, where wristbands are being issued for entry to the cathedral. The public have been warned the queue is likely to involve standing for a number of hours. Mourners are advised to bring their own food and drinks. Toilets will be available and visitors will be able to leave the queue briefly to use the facilities. There will be airport-style security checks for entering St Giles' at George IV Bridge and certain restrictions will apply on mobile phones, with photography and recording not permitted. The Royal Household has asked that floral tributes are left at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. On Tuesday, the Queen's coffin will be flown from Edinburgh Airport to Buckingham Palace.  From Thursday, the Queen will lie in state at Westminster Hall for four days. Her funeral will take place at Westminster Abbey on Monday, 19 September. What next?

The King said Parliament was the \"living and breathing instrument of our democracy\" as he spoke in front of 900 MPs and peers at Westminster Hall. It followed condolences from speakers of the House of Commons and Lords. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, House of Commons speaker, said \"as deep as our grief is, we know yours is deeper\".  Addressing the King on behalf of MPs, Sir Lindsay added: \"We know you hold the greatest respect, the precious traditions, the freedoms, and responsibilities of our unique history and our system of parliamentary government. \"We know that you will bear those responsibilities which fall to you with the fortitude, dignity, demonstrated by Her late Majesty.\" The King, in his response, said: \"While very young, Her Late Majesty pledged herself to serve her country and her people and to maintain the precious principles of constitutional government which lie at the heart of our nation. This vow she kept with unsurpassed devotion. \"She set an example of selfless duty which, with God's help and your counsels, I am resolved faithfully to follow.\"  State trumpeters played a fanfare as King Charles made his way through Westminster Hall at 10:25 BST while the Royal Standard was raised in place of the half mast. Built in 1097, Westminster Hall has played a significant role in British history across the centuries. \"I cannot help but feel the weight of history which surrounds us and which reminds us of the vital parliamentary traditions to which members of both houses dedicate yourselves, with such personal commitment for the betterment of us all,\" the King said in his address. \"Parliament is the living and breathing instrument of our democracy. That your traditions are ancient we see in the construction of this great hall and the reminders of medieval predecessors of the office to which I have been called.\" At the ceremony - which took place in the same hall where the Queen's coffin will lie in state later this week - the monarch, accompanied by Camilla, Queen Consort, were offered condolences on behalf of both Houses of Parliament. Lord McFall paid tribute to the late Queen and said she \"captured the imagination of peoples across the globe\". \"We remember her commitment, her kindness, her humour, her courage and her fortitude as well as the deep faith which was the anchor in her life,\" he added. \"We are proud and humbled to welcome you as King.\" Also among the attendees in the hall was Ugbana Oyet, the first black sergeant at arms in the role's history.  Monday's visit to Westminster also saw members of both houses pledging loyalty to the new monarch. The audience at Westminster Hall formed a \"who's who\" of contemporary politicians. Party leaders chatting amiably in the front few rows, cabinet ministers of decades past now in the House of Lords a few rows back. \"There is nobody in either House who has taken an oath of allegiance to anybody other than Queen Elizabeth,\" Conservative peer and former MP Lord Cormack said after the ceremony. \"I've been here 52 years, I've taken the oath 14 times. On Saturday for the first time to the new King.\" Younger parliamentarians, like Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, who became Labour MP for Slough in 2017, were conscious of just how rare it is for MPs to be part of the transition to a new monarch. \"It is a very privileged position we find ourselves in,\" he said. Read Chris Mason and Brian Wheeler's full report here.  After the ceremony, the King and Queen Consort travelled to Edinburgh, the city where the Queen's coffin has been lying-in-rest since Sunday.  There, they were greeted by large crowds before they continued on to the Palace of Holyroodhouse for the Ceremony of Keys. The trip marks the start of a royal tour of all four nations of the UK.  One well-wisher among the crowd outside the palace thanked the King and the Queen Consort for the UK's support for Ukraine during the nation's conflict with Russia.  The ceremony at Holyroodhouse was followed by a procession along the Royal Mile to St Giles' Cathedral.  The King and his siblings - the Princess Royal, Earl of Wessex and Duke of York - walked behind the Queen's coffin as it made its way along the Royal Mile. The Duke of York did not wear military uniform because he is no longer a working royal, although is expected to as a special mark of respect at a final vigil to be held at Westminster Hall.   At the cathedral, the Royal Family were joined by a congregation drawn from all areas of Scottish society for a service of thanksgiving for the Queen's life.  Later in the evening, the King and his family will observe a vigil at the cathedral in honour of the Queen.  Her coffin will remain at the cathedral for 24 hours for members of the public to pay their respects, before being flown back to RAF Northolt and then travelling on to Buckingham Palace.

He and the Queen Consort will then attend the Scottish Parliament, where members will deliver a motion of condolence at 17:30 BST.  Since the Queen died at Balmoral on Thursday, thousands of mourners have laid flowers and tributes at places she lived, including Buckingham Palace, Sandringham House and Windsor Castle.  More than 750,000 could file past the Queen's coffin in Westminster Hall during her lying-in-state later this week. Mourners wishing to do so have been warned queues could reach 20 hours.  The last member of the Royal Family to lie in state in the hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster, was the Queen Mother in 2002 when more than 200,000 people queued to view her coffin.  Sir Peter Bottomley, father of the House of Commons, said he expected \"we'll see 10 times more than that\" this week.  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It is a magnificent opportunity for people to come through Westminster Hall and actually feel the modernity of the monarchy and the tradition.\" Sir Peter said the events of the past few days showed how in the space of a week you can change the head of state and the prime minister and have people taking to the streets \"with love and flowers\".

He tendered his resignation to the Queen at Balmoral Castle in Scotland on Tuesday last week before she appointed his replacement, Liz Truss. Mr Johnson told the BBC he was moved by the Queen's \"sense of duty\" when her death was announced two days later. He said he thought the British monarchy would endure thanks to the Queen. While she modernised and \"revolutionised\" the UK's constitutional monarchy, Mr Johnson said, her greatest achievement was assuring the succession to her son, King Charles III. The 14th prime minister of the Queen's 70-year reign, Mr Johnson reflected on the late monarch's life and the impression she left on him during their encounters while he was in office. Like every prime minister, Mr Johnson held weekly audiences with the Queen to inform her about matters of national importance. Describing their final meeting, when he offered his resignation, Mr Johnson said: \"Given how ill she obviously was, how amazing it was that she be so bright and focused. It was a pretty emotional time.\" In the last of the BBC's series of interviews with former prime ministers, presenter Fiona Bruce asked Mr Johnson if he was ever too busy to attend his weekly audience with the Queen. \"No, you must be joking,\" Mr Johnson said, describing his regular meetings with the Queen as \"a fantastic break from everything else\" and \"a wonderful moment of tranquillity\". During the Covid-19 pandemic, some of those weekly audiences were held virtually while social-distancing regulations were in force in England, and across the UK. Mr Johnson recalled how his government worked with Buckingham Palace to organise a special address to the nation, delivered by the Queen during the first lockdown in April 2020. In it, the Queen reassured the nation \"we will meet again\", evoking the words of the Vera Lynn wartime song and the UK's blitz spirit during World War Two. Mr Johnson said the message was \"incredibly important\", and even pop stars \"wouldn't have the same impact as that broadcast\". The Queen's husband, Prince Philip, died in April last year and was laid to rest a week later at a funeral in the private chapel in Windsor Castle. The congregation wore masks and was socially distanced in line with Covid rules at the time, with the Queen seated alone. It later emerged that Covid rule-busting parties were held in Downing Street on the eve of the funeral. \"How did you two get past that?\" Mr Johnson was asked. \"Because of her great sense of constitutional function she never got into that sort of conversation,\" Mr Johnson said. \"She was really absolutely focused on what she saw as the important issues. It's a very trusting environment, the audience with Her Majesty. So that never came up.\" What was discussed, though, \"was just about everything under the sun\", Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said the Queen was an \"amazing authority about history, about politics\" and knew everyone, from former US President John F Kennedy, to former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. And he referred to the \"sweep of progress\" over the past 70 years, saying: \"That's why I think she should be Elizabeth the Great, by the way, because look at what happened to this country in her reign.
